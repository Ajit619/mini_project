# myproject
This project is an exciting fun game for beginners to build up. The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified and the user must guess the number after a hint from the computer. Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score. The clue any math clue like multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.   The program also requires functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user or not, to compare the input number with the actual number, to find the difference between the two numbers.
